      content="The growing concern of investors regarding the prospect of a new conflict between Israel and Lebanon, where the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group is based, significantly increases the risk of a major war in the Middle East. If Israeli troops begin an offensive on Lebanon, the armies of the Arab League may join the fighting, and the economy of the United States and other Western countries may again find itself under an oil export embargo, which creates the risk of renewed inflation, against the backdrop of increased growth in oil prices.
